# README

WantedItem is a Cobblemon side mod adding special items for server admins.

- Pokemon Lucky Egg
- Item Lucky Box
- Randomizer
- Bottle Caps

This is not unique work of mine and is motivated work of Cobblemizer and Umimplemented Items. Most of the textures have been reworked based on Cobblemon Assets but few of them are from the two mods. I do not intend to provide crafting recipes or acquisition methods for items included in this mod.

## Lucky Egg

- Mythical
- Paradox
- Ultra Beast Pokémon.

- Cobblemon Model items.

### Myths and Legends Lucky Box

In spite of its name, Ditto Residue does nothing. Server admins can use it as an ingredient for duplicating items.
